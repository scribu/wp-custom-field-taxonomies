Convert custom fields to tags, categories or taxonomy terms

== Description ==

Custom fields are great for storing various meta data about a post. However, if you routinely need to display posts that have a certain custom field value, you should consider switching to a custom taxonomy. [Taxonomies](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies) are similar to custom fields, except they are optimized for grouping posts. Taxonomies you are probably familiar with are tags and categories.

With this simple plugin, you can convert all custom fields with a certain key to terms in a certain taxonomy, while maintaining the post association.

**Note:** If you're looking for the old version, see [Query Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/query-custom-fields/)

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).

Make sure your host is running PHP 5. The only foolproof way to do this is to add this line to wp-config.php (after the opening `<?php` tag):
